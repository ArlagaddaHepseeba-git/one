Project:End-to-End CI/CD Pipeline for Java Web Application using Jenkins, GitHub, Nexus, and Tomcat on AWS EC2

-->Built an automated CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins Pipeline on AWS EC2
-->Automated Java application build using Maven with SonarQube quality checks
-->Stored build artifacts in Nexus Repository Manager
-->Deployed WAR files automatically to Apache Tomcat
-->Reduced manual work and improved build reliability
